# apod.widget
Ãœbersicht APOD desktop image and video

Updated 15 Oct 2021 - Bug fix 18 Oct 2021

What's new

Complete rewrite. All Mac's should have everything installed and ready to go. 
Just configure apod.jsx to suit your Mac.
And get an API key from NASA. It's free and easy. 
I have included a 'default.jpg' which you can replace with anything you like as long as it is called 'default.jpg' and isn't too big (1-3Mb).

Configuration

Only 1 must be changed - the API key. It will be 40 characters long.
Go to https://api.nasa.gov
Fill in the three required fields.
Copy the key into the apod.jsx script. Not the web address, just the key above it.
Done.

These are 11 lines that control virtually everything. 

export const folder = "/APOD/" // the name of folder inside the main widgets folder

export const durationMs = 60 * 60 * 1000 // time between update checks in milliseconds x 1000 x 60 x 60 = 1 hour

export const width = 1440 // change to your screen width

export const height = 900 // change to your screen height

export const dock = 90 // height of your dock - so the caption will clear it. Take a guess.

export const colour = "000000" // background colour. This is black.

export const captionWidth = 450 // width of the caption

export const margin = 10 // left margin for the caption

export const ESToffset = -18 // get the hours offset for EST in the US for your location.

export const apiKey = "DEMO_KEY" // get your api key at api.nasa.govt (it's free and not hard)

export const imageOut = "imgfit.jpg" // The name of the desktop image - if you change this it could break

That should do it. I've tested on a few Macs of mine and it worked.
Disclaimer

I have no idea what I'm doing. 
Use this at your own risk. It shouldn't break anything. It doesn't write anything outside of this directory it's installed in. Check the apod.jsx and apod.sh files in a text editor. They are commented as to what is going on.
Rememnber, I wrote it for myself. If it can be improved please help me learn. 
Change it as you wish but please share the improvements with me: github@skunkworks.net.nz
